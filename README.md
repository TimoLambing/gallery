## :oncoming_police_car: Roadmap:

-   [x] Initial release
-   [ ] Add authentication support
-   [ ] Full SSG support for the ipx provider

## :rocket: Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local development environment or deploy in production.

## Local Development

_Note_ this project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Replace with `npm run` or `yarn` if needed.

Get started

```
git clone https://github.com/c1llo/gallery.git
```

```
cd gallery
```

```
pnpm install
```

Development mode

```
pnpm dev
```

## :parachute: Supported  production deployment methods

-   With Docker [see Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (deploy to any PaaS that supports Docker or self-host). DigitalOcean app platform is recommended.
-   With Vercel: [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fc1llo%2Fgallery)

**Note** to host with Docker you will need to change the image provider to the self-hosted [`ipx`](https://v1.image.nuxtjs.org/providers/ipx) provider within the Nuxt config:

```
//nuxt.config.ts

image: {
    provider: "ipx",
    ...
},

```

See instructions for deploying on Vercel [here](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel).
It works out of the box and by default the vercel provider is used by `@nuxt/image-edge` for image optimisation.
