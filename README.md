## :oncoming_police_car: Roadmap:
- [x] Initial release
- [ ] Add authentication support
- [ ] Full SSG support

## :rocket: Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local development environment or deploy in production.

## Local Development

*Note* this project uses `pnpm` as the package manager. Replace with `npm run` or `yarn` if needed.

Get started

```
git clone https://github.com/c1llo/gallery.git
```
```
cd gallery
```
```
pnpm install
```

Development mode

```
pnpm dev
```

## :parachute: Deployment

-   With Docker [see Dockerfile](Dockerfile) (deploy to any PaaS that supports Docker or self-host). DigitalOcean app platform is recommended.
-   [Vercel](vercel.com)

See instructions for deploying on Vercel [here](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/vercel).
It works out of the box and by default the vercel provider is used by `@nuxt/image-edge` for image optimisation.

## Important directories

-   `src`
    -   `src/components`  
    -   `src/composables`
    -   `src/pages` 
    -   `src/public/images` stores all the original image files
    -   `src/types`
-   `test`
    -   `test/e2e` stores all Playwright E2E tests

## Running the tests

Vitest + Playwright

Unit tests: 

`pnpm test:unit`

E2E tests (this may require other Playwright dependencies to be installed): 

`pnpm test:e2e`
